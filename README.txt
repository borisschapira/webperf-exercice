# Team Web Performance Exercise

## Requirements

- Even number of teams of at least 2 persons
- Two and a half hours or more

## Timeline

### Phase 1 (90 minutes)

Each team is assigned the default template. During 90 minutes, they will have two objectives:

**The first objective** is to degrade the web performance of the page as much as possible while being discreet enough that a user may not notice it immediately.

**The second objective** is to maintain a record of the team's work in a **registry**:

- All your ideas regarding possible degradations
- Within them, those the team had time to implement

At the end of Phase 1, the team registy may contain several ideas for degradations that the team has thought about without having time to code them.

_**Tip**: Do not degrade the page with the same technique several times in different places on the page. This will not earn you more points, will waste time, and will make the degradation easier to spot._

### Phase 2 (10 minutes)

Each team sends the fruit of its work to another, but not its team register, which remains secret. To taunt the opposing team, a team can state the total number of degradation ideas, without specifying how many have actually been implemented.

### Phase 3 (40 minutes or more)

Each team tries to achieve three objectives.

**The first objective** is to list, in a new specifc area of their **registry**, all the degratations the team isable to detect.

**The second objective** is to fix them.

**The last objective** is to fix them in a way the user experience is even better than in the original template.

### Last Phase (20 minutes)

In turn, the teams are asked about the degradations they thought about in Phase 1:

- For each degradation implemented and not detected by the opposite team, **5 points**.
- For each degradation implemented and detected by the opposite team ("_the fixers_"), **3 points**.
- If the fixers were able to propose a fix that is even better than the original code, **3 points** for them too.
- If the fixers were able to think about a fix without having time to implement it, **2 points** for them
- If the fixers detected the issue but were not able to propose a fixe, **1 point** for them.
- For each degradation though about but not implemented, **1 point**.

Say hello to Editorial, a blog/magazine-ish template built around a toggleable "locking"
sidebar (scroll down to see what I mean) and an accordion-style menu. Not the usual landing
page/portfolio affair you'd expect to see at HTML5 UP, but I figured for my 41st (!!!)
template I'd change it up a little. Enjoy :)
